# 2SFTagsToNCSF

A command-line program to copy tags from an existing 2SF set to an NCSF set.

**NOTE:** This program has yet to be tested. It probably works, but there are no guarantees that it does work.

To see how to use this, you can run `2SFTagsToNCSF.exe -h`.
If you have downloaded the repository, you could also look at the Program.docopt.txt file for this information.
