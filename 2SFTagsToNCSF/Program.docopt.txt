2SF Tags to NCSF
By Naram Qashat (CyberBotX) [cyberbotx@cyberbotx.com]

2SF Tags to NCSF will copy tags from a 2SF set and place them into the tags of
an NCSF set.

NOTE: This may only work on 2SFs that were created with Legacy of Ys as the
driver, any other 2SFs may not work.

Usage:
  2SFTagsToNCSF.exe (-h | --help)
  2SFTagsToNCSF.exe (-V | --version)
  2SFTagsToNCSF.exe [-rv -x EXCLUDE...] INPUTDIR OUTPUTDIR

Options:
  -h, --help             Show help message.
  -V, --version          Show version.
  -r, --rename           Renames the NCSFs to match the 2SFs.
  -v, --verbose          Verbose output.
  -x, --exclude EXCLUDE  Exclude the given tag from the tags to copy.

Verbose output will output the tags that were copied.

Regardless of which tags are excluded on the command line, the _lib, 2sfby,
length and fade tags will always be excluded from the conversion process.
